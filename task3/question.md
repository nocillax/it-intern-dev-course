**TASK #3**

Use the language of your specialization.

Implement a web method accessible via HTTP GET that accepts two natural numbers, x and y, and returns their lowest common multiple. The result should be a plain string containing only digits â€” not HTML or any other format. If either x or y is not a natural number, return the string NaN.

Deploy the method so that it is accessible on the Internet at a URL that ends with your email address, where all characters except English letters and digits are replaced with underscores. For example, if your email is p.lebedev@itransition.com, the URL might be: http://something.something.com:port/something/p_lebedev_itransition_com.

Append query parameters ?x={}&y={} to the end of the URL during solution submission. To submit your solution, use the following template:
!task3 md.smith2@mail-srv.com http://free.hoster.org/app/md_smith2_mail_srv_com?x={}&y={}
